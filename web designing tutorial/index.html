    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance
         of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring,
          including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization.
           Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
           [1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup.
            Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to
             date with web accessibility guidelines.<a href="./wterms.html"> LEARN MORE.....</a></p>

HTML elements are the building blocks 
of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
images and other objects such as 
interactive forms may be embedded 
into the rendered page. 
HTML provides a means to create 
structured documents by denoting 
structural semantics for text such 
as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
links, quotes, and other items.

CSS isdesigned to enabletheseparation 
of content and presentation, 
including layout, colors, and fonts.
[3] This separation can improve 
content accessibility;[further 
explanation needed] provide more 
flexibility and control in the 
specification of presentation 
characteristics; enable multiple 
web pages to share formatting by 
specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight 
interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) 
programming language 
with first-class functions. 
While it is most well-known 
as the scripting language for 
 Web pages,many non-browser 
environments also use it, such 
as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and 
Adobe Acrobat.

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, 
do more", JavaScript library. The purpose 
of jQuery is to make it much easier to use 
JavaScript on your website. 
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that 
 require many lines of JavaScript code to 
accomplish, and wraps them into methods 
that you can call with a single line of code.

<pre>
Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that 
focuses on simplifying the development of 
informative web pages (as opposed to web 
applications). The primary purpose of 
adding it to a web project is to apply
Bootstrap's choices of color, size, 
font and layout to that project. 
As such, the primary factor is 
whether the developers in charge 
find those choices to their liking. 
Once added to a project, Bootstrap 
provides basic style definitions for 
all HTML elements.

elements, making complex web 
applications easier to manage and 
maintain. React is used to build 
single-page applications.
