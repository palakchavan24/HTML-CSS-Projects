# HTML-CSS-Projects
HTML and CSS projects build web development skills by combining structure (HTML) and style (CSS). Projects like portfolios, landing pages, or blogs teach layouts, responsive design, and animations. They foster creativity, improve problem-solving, and prepare developers for advanced tools while creating visually appealing web pages.
